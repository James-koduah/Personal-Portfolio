# What makes you an expert in a programming language


How would you define expertise in a programming language?

Is it knowledge of all the mechanics and advanced concepts of the language? Or is it based on the number of functional projects youâ€™ve built?

There might be a situation where you know enough about a language to complete a variety of tasks without necessarily knowing some deep aspects because you never needed them. Does this qualify you for the title of â€˜expertâ€™? Or do you need to know sufficient libraries and paradigms of the language to be considered one?

Itâ€™s just like speaking a human language. Some people can speak English but still fail English exams, sure you don't qualify as a professor, but compared to a non-native speaker who is trying to learn, youâ€™re really good!

Maybe being an expert is relative.
Maybe being an expert is not a destination, but a never ending journey.
Maybe the answer to this question is really how many questions youâ€™ve answered on Stack Overflow ðŸ˜….

What do you think? Are you an expert?
